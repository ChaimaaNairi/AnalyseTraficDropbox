# AnalyseTraficDropbox

AnalyseTraficDropbox is a project aimed at analyzing network traffic generated by Dropbox clients. The project involves capturing network packets using Wi-Fi and 4G connections, analyzing them with Wireshark, and extracting insights to understand Dropbox's communication patterns.

## Introduction
Dropbox is a popular cloud storage service that synchronizes files across devices. Analyzing its network traffic can provide valuable insights into how it operates, what data it transfers, and how it communicates with its servers. The AnalyseTraficDropbox project aims to dissect and understand this network traffic.

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaimaaNairi/AnalyseTraficDropbox.git
```

## Usage

1. **Capture Network Traffic**:
   - Use Wireshark or tcpdump to capture network packets while Dropbox is running over Wi-Fi and 4G connections.
   - Save the captured packets to a file (e.g., `capture.pcap`).

2. **Analyze Traffic**:
   - Run the analysis script provided in the `scripts/` directory.
   - Specify the path to the captured packet file as an argument.
   - The script will process the packets and extract relevant information.

3. **Explore Insights**:
   - Review the output of the analysis script to understand Dropbox's network behavior.
   - Extract insights such as server communication patterns, data transfer volumes, etc.
